# searchWebFromTerminal

Sometimes I find myself in the Mac Terminal and want to google something or jump straight to Youtube with a direct query.<br>
For that I made a little script that helps me do that:<br>

## Prerequisits

1. have the script somewhere on your system ( ***macOS only*** ) 
2. make an ```alias``` to your ```~/.bash_alias``` to call the script for convenience
3. done.

## My Settings

I have an ```alias sw="~/dev/bash/searchWeb.sh"```. To call it simply type ```sw``` and off you go.<br>
There is also a browser choice enabled. To choose between Firefox, Chromium or Safari as default.<br>
Type ```sw f``` to open Firefox, ```sw c``` for Chromium. Of course they need to be installed.<br><br>
